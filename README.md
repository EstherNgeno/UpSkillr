# UpSkillr - Project Pitch

### Introduction

UpSkillr is a unique platform designed to connect people who want to learn new skills with those who are eager to teach them. Instead of paying for expensive courses or services, users can exchange their skills freely. Whether you're a graphic designer wanting to learn photography, or a coder looking to improve your cooking, UpSkillr makes skill exchange easy and accessible.

### The Problem

Learning new skills is often locked behind paywalls, creating financial barriers for many people. Meanwhile, countless individuals have valuable expertise to offer but don't know how to share it. There’s a huge gap between people who want to learn and those who can teach, and UpSkillr is here to bridge that gap.
